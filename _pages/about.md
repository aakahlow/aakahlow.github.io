This is an exciting time to be a computer architect. Traditional performance gains owing to scaling of transistor size are diminishing, applications are increasingly getting diverse and researchers have been continuously exposing micro-architectural and architectural vulnerabilities. I am passionate about research in Computer Architecture. Generally, the idea of doing research in computing inspires me. I also like to work at the intersection of Computer Architecture and areas like Information Security and Machine Learning.

At UC Davis I am part of UC Davis Architecture Research ([DArchR](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/)) group and advised by [Prof. Jason Lowe-Power](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/jason-lowe-power). I am also an affiliate at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/idf/affiliates/ayaz-akram/).

My current research interests revolve around heterogeneous memory management within the context of secure and high-performant HPC (high performance computing) hardware. For now, we are focusing on analyzing and characterizing the commonly used trusted execution environments for HPC applications.
I am also involved in building support infrastructure for reproducible and structured research with [gem5](http://www.gem5.org/) (famous architecture simulator).

In my past life, I have worked on building and analyzing detection techniques for cache side channel attacks, analyzing the performance differences among different instruction set architectures (ISAs), and investigating computer architecture simulators.
